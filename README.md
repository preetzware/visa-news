## Design
### Colour Scheme
The website features a calming and professional color palette that combines shades of blue, violet, and green with complementary neutrals. <br>
Overall, this color scheme creates a professional and user-friendly environment, with subtle variations in hue and transparency to guide users' attention and enhance the visual appeal of the website.

### Database Schema
![database schema]()

#### Models
1. Allauth User Model

The User model is part of Django Allauth. The model comes with predefined fields as standard. Some of them are username, email, name, password, and more. This model is used for user authentication, hence why changes directly to this model are not advisory. The User model is connected to the Profile model with one to one relationship. 

2. visa_app(Home Page) Model

The Profile model is a custom custom-created model to handle the user profile details. Signals are used to reflect the changes between the User and Profile models. For example, if the Profile gets updated or deleted the changes will apply to the user model as well. 

3. Visanews Model

The listing model is connected to the Profile with a ForeignKey field - owner. It is furthermore connected to the CarMake and CarModel models via ForeignKey field again


### Fonts
The font used in this project is Roboto Slab, which compliments the design of the website. <br>
